Sillysleeves - Design-your-own

This is a JavaScript application I developed for the website of company Sillysleeves, who sells zip-on animal sleeves and vest for kids.

It's designed to allow users to draw images in the web browser and save them to their computer or device. It works on desktop and touch-screen devices, working within a Wordpress framework.

It uses sketcher.js, Twitter Bootstrap, Modernizr, and FileSaver (canvas-toBlob.js).
